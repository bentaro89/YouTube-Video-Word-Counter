# YouTube-Video-Word-Counter

I wrote this script after watching a YouTube video where the speaker would use the same words repeatedtly. I wanted to keep track of how many times each word was said in the video. I integrated the script with a discord bot/server so my friends could also use it. 

This script allows users to input a youtube video link on a discord server which will make a discord bot output how many words are said in the video and how many times each word is said. The script parses the subtitles and uses a dictionary to keep track of the amount of times a word appears.

Total programming time = 4 hours.
